## Business Requirements
Provide students with personalized learning experiences using GenAI to adapt to their skill level and learning pace.

## Functional Requirements

- Support for text-to-text (chatbot), text correction, and speech synthesis
- Context retention for session-based interactions (limited to session duration)
- Connect with existing CRM and student databases
- Ensure compliance with GDPR and other regional data protection standards

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Scalability: Must support 100 concurrent users at launch with the ability to scale up for future growth.
- Performance: Real-time response latency < 200 ms for chat-based interactions.
- Security: Encryption of all student data at rest and in transit.
- Cost-Efficiency: Optimize GPU usage for AI models to manage operational costs.

##

-  Model Selection: Use an open-source LLM for text generation to avoid vendor lock-in (e.g., LLaMA, ChatGPT)
- Infrastructure Design:
   * Compute:
   - 2 NVIDIA A100 GPUs for production environment
   - AWS for scalability and access to GPU instances
   * Storage:
   - PostgreSQL for relational data (user profiles, learning progress, content management)
    - Amazon S3 for storing generated content and media (audio, video)

## Constraints

- Budget: Limited to $100,000 for initial development and deployment.
- Timeline: Platform must be live within 6 months.
